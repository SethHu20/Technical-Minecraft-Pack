# Technical Minecraft Pack

1.21+ fabric modpack suitable for technical vanilla survival gameplay, especially technical MC players in single player survival or SMP servers (building and designing farms, storage, other contraptions).

This project will only be maintained for the newest Minecraft release. The modpack will also aim to fulfill creative gameplay and designing needs, once I decided what redstone tool mods to add.

The modpack is available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/technical-minecraft-pack), and is best used with a launcher compatible of importing modrinth modpacks (such as [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/)).

## Description

Existing technical minecraft oriented modpacks tends to heavily modify the controls and looks, meanwhile modpacks such as adrenaline (which this modpack had slightly based upon) lacks the features needed. This modpack aims to be **fully featured**, which means it won't be lightweight, while being least invasive to vanilla controls and gameplay as possible.

Most players can then use this modpack by doing either of the following:
- **highly recommend** updating the mods using your favourite launcher
- simply disable mods as needed (or won't, as it may not even interfere normal gameplay), otherwise modify config (or disable) the mod in game
- copy over their config folders to get their usual settings and keybindings
- copy shaderpacks (complementary shaders included by default), resourcepacks, saves, screenshots, schematics, etc.
- configure their mods and keybinds and adapt to the new modpack
- hopefully, players will spend less time to find and install mods they need

## This project is under Beta

Players choosing to utilise this modpack long term should consider the following notes on how the modpack, as its currently under beta, will develop in the future:
- the modpack is intended to be a list of mods, and will only be updated for inclusion or exclusion of new mods. Once again, players are highly encouraged to update them to the newest version themselves
- the modpack will prioritise technical SMP experience, so mods that enhances multiplayer and survival experience will be maintained more frequently than single player or creative experience mods.
- the author will test out new mods, they are more likely / faster to be added to the modpack if it, by rough order of importance:
  - does not change any bevaiour by default and is opt-in based
  - does not cause conflicts with other mods
  - does not cause keybind conflicts
  - does not intefere with the GUI
  - allows users to easily migrate configs
  - encountered any of the issues above, yet it can be passed off as a minor inconvenience
  - encountered any of the issues above, which then have configs to mitigate them
  With that being said, features are important. Even "invasive" mods such as essential mod or multimeter will eventually find their way into the modpack, given that users who dislike them can still disable it through configs, or worst case scenario, disabling it through the launcher
- resource and shader packs will be included
